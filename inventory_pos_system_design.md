# Inventory Management and Point-of-Sale System Design

## Implementation Approach

For this inventory management and point-of-sale application, we'll use a modern web stack with React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB as our database. This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and ease of development.

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js for UI components and state management
- Redux for global state management
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React-to-print for receipt generation
- Chart.js for data visualization

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express framework
- MongoDB for database
- Mongoose as ODM (Object Document Mapper)
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing

**Development Tools:**
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Jest for testing
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Challenging Aspects and Solutions

1. **Material-Product Relationship Management**
   - Challenge: Tracking how raw materials are consumed by products and updating inventory accordingly.
   - Solution: Implement a relational schema within MongoDB that links products to their material requirements with quantity mappings.

2. **Real-time Inventory Updates**
   - Challenge: Ensuring inventory levels are accurate after sales and production.
   - Solution: Implement transactional operations for inventory updates when recording sales or creating products.

3. **Cost Calculation Accuracy**
   - Challenge: Maintaining accurate cost calculations for products based on material costs.
   - Solution: Use weighted average cost method and recalculate product costs when material costs change.

4. **Receipt Generation**
   - Challenge: Creating printable, professional receipts.
   - Solution: Use React-to-print library with customizable templates that can be rendered as PDF or printed directly.

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The system will use the following core data structures:

### Core Entities

1. User - Store admin and staff accounts
2. InventoryItem - Raw materials and ingredients
3. Product - Items made from inventory items
4. Recipe - Mapping between products and inventory items
5. Sale - Sales transaction records
6. SaleItem - Individual items in a sale
7. Customer - Customer information for receipts

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Staff)
   - Token expiration and refresh mechanism

2. **Data Protection**
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - HTTPS for data in transit
   - Input validation and sanitization

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration
   - Request validation middleware

### Scalability Approach

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless backend design allows for multiple instances
   - Load balancing with Nginx

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Indexing for frequently queried fields
   - Caching with Redis for common queries
   - Database sharding strategy for future growth

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Code splitting and lazy loading for frontend
   - API response pagination
   - Background processing for resource-intensive operations

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/reports/inventory` - Get inventory reports
- `GET /api/reports/costs` - Get cost reports
- `GET /api/reports/revenue` - Get revenue reports

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Material Costing Method**: The PRD doesn't specify if the system should use FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average for costing methods when materials are purchased at different prices. I've assumed a weighted average approach, but this should be clarified.

2. **Multi-location Support**: It's unclear if the system needs to support multiple locations or warehouses. The current design is for a single location but could be extended.

3. **Discount and Tax Handling**: The requirements don't specify how discounts and taxes should be handled in sales and receipts. The system design includes basic support, but specific requirements might need clarification.

4. **User Roles and Permissions**: The specific permissions for different user roles need to be detailed further. The current design includes basic role-based access control.
